Can choose to follow either MIT or Unlicense; MIT made available in case
Unlicense does not legally apply in your jurisdiction.

Note: "index.html" lines 228-268 use math equations / numbers from various
places, but not any code, so should be clear to count that function as
MIT+Unlicense like rest of code in repository.
